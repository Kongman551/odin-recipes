The Odin Project Foundations - Recipes

## Summary
After completing the ruby course and small section on databases, I decided to go back to the Foundations section because I noiced that a few sections with projects had been added. Kind of missed HTML and CSS, so I jumped back to freshen up before starting Ruby on Rails portion.
